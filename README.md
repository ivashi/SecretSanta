# SecretSanta

# This program will ask for the number of participants, then ask for all the names and randomly assign someone for them to gift

# For informing currently this program calls one individual to the screen, gives them the name, then skips about 100 lines and calls the next person to the screen

# EDITS TO MAKE

# 1. make it so that everyone is emailed who they are gifting so that all users don't have to be present

# 2. when asking for user names, also ask for who that user is comfortable giving gifts to, as there are some instances where not everyone in the group knows everyone else
